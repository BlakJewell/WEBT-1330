                <p>In the good old days to be sniper meant being an elite sharpshooter, the best of the best, with eagle eyes, nerves of steel and iron asses. To ensure their one and only shot didn't sail by the target, they had to consider dozens of factors that could affect the bullet's path. Today, anyone who has the right cyberware and a padded bank account can be a deadeye marksman. This Tsunami sniper rifle patches target intel and magnified images directly into optical cyberware, and it can automatically compensate for deviations in projectile trajectory. The Ashura has the spotter built directly into the hardware. Never miss again.</p>

                <p>The Ashura is a single-shot sniper rifle equipped with a highly sensitive targeting device and scanning software integrated directly into its design. Although it can chamber only one dart round at a time, the size of this dart is much larger and deadlier than that of other Smart projectiles.

                    A Smart Link cyberware implant is required to fully utilize the weapons Smart capabilities.
                    
                    Because of the weapon's integrated systems, it is not possible to install a Scope or Muzzle attachment.</p>
