                <p>Just like Achilles, mythical, nearly invincible warrior of Ancient Greece, this Militech weapon is also unsurpassed in its class: the M-179 Achilles is truly the best electromagnetic precision rifle on the market. The Achilles features an ultra-long range alongside fierce power – meaning the bullets hit home just as hard, even at great distances. A sniper equipped with the Achilles can easily pierce through walls or armored vehicles.

                    Now, the mythical Achilles had one fatal weakness. What about his namesake? Well, perhaps one flaw would be its complicated, difficult-to-use construction, not to mention its steep price point. That's why the M-179 Achilles is hard to find on Night City's mean streets.</p>

                <h1>m-179e Achilles</h1>

                <p>The Achilles is the most powerful precision rifle available on the market. Each round fired with the Achilles will split up into a pentagon pattern comprised of 5 individual projectiles. When charged, the weapon will concentrate the projectiles in a center spot, inflicting maximum damage to anything or anyone hit, even through whatever cover or object may be in front of them.

                    The weapon has a maximum clip size of 9 rounds. It does not have a scope slot and instead comes equipped with holographic iron sights by default.
                    
                    Due to the Tech mechanism in place, it is not possible to install a Muzzle.</p>
