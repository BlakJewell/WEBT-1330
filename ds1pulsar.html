                <p>The DS1 Pulsar is a bullpup designed, fully automatic submachine gun with an extremely high fire rate. It has a standard magazine size of 40 rounds. Due to its compact design, the weapon is known to be difficult to handle with extreme recoil, making it an inaccurate firearm.

                    It is possible to install a Scope and Muzzle attachment. You've got to hand it to the designers at Darra – they don't shy away from a little experimentation. The Pulsar looks as if someone first dismantled your typical machine gun, then had a blindfolded kindergartener mash it back together. And yet! There's a method to the madness. Thanks to Darra's unconventional approach, the Pulsar is smaller than most guns of its kind, making it easier to conceal. Unfortunately, originality comes at a price: for all its design flair, the gun's got a killer kickback and is notoriously hard to handle. The quality of its parts also leaves much to be desired. In short, Pulsar is a semi-failed experiment, but for some, its low, low price point makes up for its flaws. You can most often find the Pulsar a weapon-of-only-resort in the slums, or tucked snugly in a rookie gangoon's holster.</p>
