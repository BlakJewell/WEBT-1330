                <h1>G-58 Dian</h1>
                <h1>Manufacturer-Kang Tao</h1>
                <h1>€$45,349.00</h1>
                <hr>
                
                <p>The G-58 has a retractable stock that can be adjusted in length, and many of the other parts of the weapon can be folded into the main body to make it more compact and allowing for concealed carry. The weapon has been outfitted with an advanced magnetic reloading system that snaps magazines into place with minimal effort, and a custom holographic sight to be used with its smart targeting system.

                    A Smart Link Cyberware implant is required to make use of the weapons' smart targeting system, which is accurate up to 25 meters.
                    
                    Because of the weapon's integrated systems, it is not possible to install a Scope or Muzzle attachment. The G-58 Dian is one of the top smartguns on the market today. You can spot it in use among even the most elite units, including the Trauma Team. And no wonder! When you're pulling a victim out of the Combat Zone, every millisec counts – there's no time to set up your shot, take a deep breath and ready, aim, fire! You just need your lead to hit home. The G-58 Dian recognizes your target and aims right for it, all automatically. You can be sure even a quick, distracted shot will land right where it should. What's more, the fully automated reloading system, ultra-sensitive radar and top-of-the-line holographic sight make shoot-em-ups a breeze.</p>
