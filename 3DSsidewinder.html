                <p>The Sidewinder by Nokota is an improved, but slightly more expensive version of the D5 Copperhead. It has been outfitted with Smart targeting system and comes equipped with a 30 round magazine that is loaded with Smart projectiles.

                    Smart Link cyberware implant is required to fully utilize the weapons Smart capabilities.
                    
                    Because of the weapon's integrated systems, it is not possible to install a Scope or Muzzle attachment. The Sidewinder is the younger – but wiser – brother to the Copperhead. Based on the same frame, Nokota engineers finally crafted their own Smart-class rifle. But to say this gun is truly "smart" is a certain overreach. The Sidewinder doesn't try to hide what it is, and it's clear it can't stand toe to toe with its counterparts from Arasaka, Militech and Kang Tao. Yes, it offers aim-assist; yes, it aids in battlefield orientation; but anyone who's ever wielded a true top-shelf smart rifle can tell you the difference in quality is obvious. Still, despite its competitive shortcomings, the Sidewinder and its approachable price tag have chiseled out a stable niche for Nokota in the smart weaponry market.</p>
