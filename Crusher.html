                <p>The very sight of the Militech Crusher is enough to bring a tear to any gun lover's eye. This powerful shotgun, designed for short-range combat, was first created in the year 2020, soon becoming one of the period's most iconic weapons. The version currently available on the market has seen some updates from the original - including a new, modern sight - but its distinctive look remains the same. Once standard-issue among corporate guards, today the Crusher is more popular among mercs with a nostalgic streak.</p>

                <p>A classic weapon, hailing from the early 2020s, the Crusher is a fully automatic shotgun with a 12-round magazine that holds 12-gauge shells, which each contain 5 pellets. The Crusher can be operated with a single hand, allowing the other hand to be used for other interactions.

                    It is possible to add a Short Scope attachment, but it is not possible to attach a Muzzle.</p>
