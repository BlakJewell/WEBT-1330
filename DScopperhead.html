                <p>The Copperhead is a mid- to long-range assault rifle with a 30-round magazine. It can be upgraded with a scope and a muzzle device. It is one of the most commonly used weapons in 2077, being cheap to acquire and easy to use.</p>
                <p>Once upon a time, in the second half of the 20th century, the world's most popular assault rifle was the AK-47 – also commonly known as the Kalashnikov, in honor of its inventor. Today, these rifles can only be found in museums as their market niche was replaced by the Nokota Copperhead. This mass-produced assault rifle sticks to the basics of functionability and reliability. There's no finesse or ingenuity to fall in love with, but many people find its dependable stopping power an endearing trait.</p>
